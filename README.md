# WeatherApp
An app that I am working on to provide weather forecast information for the users location.

I used a weather API to provide the most recent data and predictions.

I used the geolocation API to access the users current position. 

The user simply presses the button, accepts the message from the browser to use their location, and the information simply loads onto the page.
